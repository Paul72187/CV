**Introduction**
Formerly in research, communications and healthcare, I have always sought to develop and learn new skills. My research and communications skills were used to drive new business ideas and increase revenue streams for established companies in the UK and across Europe. My research and communicactions work became increasingly data-driven, using VBA and SPSS, which encouraged me to take the leap into coding and software development, enticed by the opportunity of using these skills to assist in developing new business ideas and/or introducing change and innovation within existing businesses.

**Work Experience**

**Domestic Healthcare (June 2013 to April 2021) ** 
Primary Carer for my father who had multidisciplinary healthcare requirements around the clock following a Stroke, developing dementia and Parkinson's disease

- Primary point of contact for all hospital consultants, GPs, community nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists, social services, Royal Trinity Hospice. My father's complex healthcare needs were constantly evolving, requiring problem-solving skills and regular adaptation to daily routines, which are vital transferable skills for entering the Tech industry.
- Trained in basic healthcare assistant role - dressing ulcerated feet, flushing/changing catheters. I am always keen to learn and develop new skills and challenge my own approach to doing things, an approach which will stand me in good stead for joining the Tech industry

- Initially the research element of my work was exclusively qualitative (focus groups/depth interviews/hall tests/assisted shopping trips/online forums), but increasingly became data driven, requiring the use of Excel VBA and SPSS to analyse sales/footfall/online engagement data. This enticed me to learn more about coding and software development, with a view to building computer programs to support/develop/improve this work.

**Skills**

1. Meticulous
2. Research
3. Empathy
Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?
